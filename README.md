## Canvas game created with help Mozilla.net

## This was one of the first projects outside of calss I did while attending Denver University's Full Stack Web Dev Boot Camp! 

#### I really enjoyed experimenting with styling and learning about the canvas element. As an artist I lov the idea of 'painting with code' and love discovering other artists doing it to!
